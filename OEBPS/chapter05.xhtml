    <h2>The Heart of the Gentle Revolution</h2>
    
    <p>The MAITREYA community represents the <span class="highlight">living embodiment</span> of the gentle revolution principles. More than just users and developers, we are a collective of creators, learners, and teachers who believe that technology should serve human flourishing rather than corporate profit.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "The gentle revolution is not about overthrowing existing systems, but about demonstrating that there is a better way—one that respects human dignity, values education, and embraces community."
    </blockquote>
